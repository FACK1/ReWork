# What’s the problem?

The fashion industry is currently very unsustainable, with millions of clothes being wasted each year. Many of us don’t know what to do with our extra piles of clothes lying around and, more often than not, these clothes are thrown in a dump rather than being recycled, sold, or repurposed. Recently, even when we give to charity, they cannot deal with the amount of items donated. So what’s the solution?

# What’s the solution?

eComit aims to help users make their wardrobe visible, provide information on each individual garment and allow the user to do whatever they see fit with this information. For example, donate it to charity, or list it on ebay to sell. eComit looks to make a circular economy where clothes are repurposed instead of thrown away.
In addition to providing users with information about their item, it also serves as an admin tool for the ReWorks team.
